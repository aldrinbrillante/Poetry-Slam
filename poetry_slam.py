'''
Create a function called get_file_lines()
It should have 1 parameter called filename, which is a string of the filename.
It should return a list of strings containing the lines of the file.

print(get_file_lines("poem.txt"))
# print a space to give space between this section and the next
print("\n")


#----------FUNCTION 2----------#
'''
Create a function called lines_printed_backwards()
It should have 1 parameter called 'lines_list,' which is a 
list of strings containing lines of your poem
It should print the lines of the poem in reverse. 
Include the original line number at the beginning of each line

#----------FUNCTION 3----------#
'''
Create a function called lines_printed_random():
have 1 parameter called lines_list
It should print the lines of your poem in randomly order.
Repeats are ok, but make sure the number of lines printed is equal to the original lines in the poem
(Line numbers do not need to be printed.) 
Hint: try using a loop and randint() from the random module.

#----------FUNCTION 4----------#
'''
Create a function called lines_printed_custom()
minimally have 1 parameter called lines_list
It should print the poem in a unique way, be creative!
Make sure that you carefully comment your custom function so itâ€™s clear what it does.
